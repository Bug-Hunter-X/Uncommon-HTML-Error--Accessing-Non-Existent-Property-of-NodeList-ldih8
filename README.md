This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to accessing non-existent properties of NodeLists.  The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.html` file offers a corrected version. The issue arises from attempting to access a property that doesn't exist on a NodeList returned by `querySelectorAll`. While this doesn't always throw a JavaScript error, it can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug issues.  The solution involves ensuring that you only access properties that are definitively present on the NodeList object or converting the NodeList to an array before attempting to manipulate it.
